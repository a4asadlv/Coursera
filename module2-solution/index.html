				HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. Markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. 
				This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most of markup (e.g. HTML) languages are human readable. Language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.

                Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
				CSS is easy to learn and understood but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document.

                 JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language. JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage. In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive, with the help of JavaScript. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application development.
				 The language was initially called LiveScript and was later renamed JavaScript. There are many programmers who think that JavaScript and Java are the same. In fact, JavaScript and Java are very much unrelated. Java is a very complex programming language whereas JavaScript is only a scripting language.
